# Sambucks

Sambucks is a secure, decentralized, and anonymous cryptocurrency that is open-source and free for anyone to use.
This project was inspired by the motivational tool Schrute Bucks.

Any naming conventions used by this cryptocurrency are purely coincidental and not meant to represent any specific individual.

## Quickstart

1. Spin-up a box running Ubuntu 16.04

2. Type the following command to install dependencies:

    ```sudo apt-get update && apt-get install -y boost1.58 libboost1.58-dev```

3. Download and install the sambucks binaries

## Building CryptoNote 

### On *nix

Dependencies: GCC 4.7.3 or later, CMake 2.8.6 or later, and Boost 1.55.

You may download them from:

* http://gcc.gnu.org/
* http://www.cmake.org/
* http://www.boost.org/
* Alternatively, it may be possible to install them using a package manager.

To build, change to a directory where this file is located, and run `make`. The resulting executables can be found in `build/release/src`.

**Advanced options:**

* Parallel build: run `make -j<number of threads>` instead of `make`.
* Debug build: run `make build-debug`.
* Test suite: run `make test-release` to run tests in addition to building. Running `make test-debug` will do the same to the debug version.
* Building with Clang: it may be possible to use Clang instead of GCC, but this may not work everywhere. To build, run `export CC=clang CXX=clang++` before running `make`.

### On Windows
Dependencies: MSVC 2013 or later, CMake 2.8.6 or later, and Boost 1.55. You may download them from:

* http://www.microsoft.com/
* http://www.cmake.org/
* http://www.boost.org/

To build, change to a directory where this file is located, and run theas commands: 
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 Win64" ..
```

And then do Build.
Good luck!
